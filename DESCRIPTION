Description: ATAC-seq, an assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin
        using sequencing, is a rapid and sensitive method for chromatin
        accessibility analysis. Compared to other methods, such as 
        MNase-seq, FAIRE-seq and DNAse-seq, ATAC-seq requires less 
        amount of the biological samples and time to process. In this
        workshop, participants will not only gain the theoretical
        understanding of the characteristics of ATAC-seq data and
        the workflow of ATAC-seq data quality assessment, but will
        also obtain hands-on experience in analyzing ATAC-seq data
        using the ATACseqQC package.
        We will provide a brief introduction to the ATAC-seq technology,
        high quality data generation and computational analysis workflow. 
        Then, we will give a demo to perform a comprehensive quality assessment
        of a typical ATAC-seq dataset using the ATACseqQC package.
        Participants will have the opportunity to analyze several excerpted
        datasets of different quality. Detailed notes and R code will be
        provided for reproducibility and follow-up practicing.
